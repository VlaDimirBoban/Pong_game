# Classic pong

Next in line of my "game dev" excapades.

Simple pong with to players, didn't bother with AI (might do it in the future).

Raylib is a great starting point to get a firm grasp on basic game dev concepts. Afterwards you can easily write your own 2D library from scratch.
There are a few other options SFML and SDL2, both are fine.
 
All assets included.
